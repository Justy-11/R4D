Real-time Drowsiness and Distraction detection system

This is a real-time Drowsiness and Distraction detection System using transfer learning. It addresses critical concerns related to driver safety and attentiveness, particularly in the context of road safety and human-machine interaction. It detects the driver's eye state and recognize various forms of distraction behaviors by analyzing real-time visual data, allowing for timely warnings and intervention.

-- Used datasets -- 
Dowsiness detection model - MRL eye dataset + Closed Eyes In The Wild (CEW) dataset + ZJU eyeblink dataset
Distraction detection model - Statefarm driver distraction dataset
