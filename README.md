# Real-time Drowsiness and Distraction Detection System for Drivers

## Overview

This is a real-time Drowsiness and Distraction Detection System using transfer learning. It addresses critical concerns related to driver safety and attentiveness, particularly in the context of road safety and human-machine interaction. It detects the driver's eye state and recognizes various forms of distraction behaviors by analyzing real-time visual data, allowing for timely warnings and intervention.

## Datasets

**Drowsiness Detection Model:**
- MRL eye dataset
- Closed Eyes In The Wild (CEW) dataset
- ZJU eyeblink dataset

**Distraction Detection Model:**
- Statefarm driver distraction dataset

## Novelty

One of the key highlights of this project is the use of a combined dataset that has not been used in any of the existing systems. This means that the model will be trained on a more diverse dataset, which could lead to improved performance.
